Explanation:
Scenario: In this example, the TemperatureConverter class provides a method to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The formula used is the well-known conversion formula: 
Fahrenheit
=(Celsius×95)+32Fahrenheit=(Celsius× 5/9)+32

Unit Tests: The TemperatureConverterTest class contains unit tests that check if the conversion logic works as expected. We use assertEquals to compare the actual output of the method with the expected values. The third argument 0.01 indicates the precision, meaning that the result must be accurate to two decimal places.

Test 1: Converts 0°C to Fahrenheit, which should return 32°F.
Test 2: Converts 100°C to Fahrenheit, which should return 212°F.
Test 3: Converts 37°C (approximate human body temperature) to Fahrenheit, which should return 98.6°F.
The unit test ensures that the method is working correctly for various typical input values. If the actual result deviates from the expected value beyond the specified tolerance (0.01), the test fails.




Scenario: The PalindromeChecker class checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case. The isPalindrome method first sanitizes the input by removing any non-letter characters and converting everything to lowercase. It then reverses the sanitized string and checks if the reversed version matches the original.

Unit Tests: The PalindromeCheckerTest class tests the isPalindrome method with various inputs to ensure it works correctly.

Test 1: Checks if "Madam" is a palindrome, which should return true.
Test 2: Checks if "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" is a palindrome (ignoring punctuation and spaces), which should return true.
Test 3: Checks if "Hello" is a palindrome, which should return false.
Test 4: Checks if "Java" is a palindrome, which should return false.
The assertTrue and assertFalse methods are used to validate whether the function returns the expected boolean result. If the result does not match the expected outcome (i.e., true when it should be false or vice versa), the test fails.

How the Unit Tests Work
Isolation: Unit tests isolate individual functions or classes and validate that they behave correctly under various conditions. Each unit test is a separate method that tests a specific aspect of the code.

Assertions: In the examples, assertEquals, assertTrue, and assertFalse methods are used to compare the actual output of the method under test with the expected output. If the comparison fails, the unit test fails, indicating that the function is not working as expected.

Test Coverage: The unit tests cover both positive and negative cases:

In the TemperatureConverter, we test for three different Celsius inputs to ensure the function works across a range of values.
In the PalindromeChecker, we test both valid palindromes (ignoring case and punctuation) and non-palindromes.
Automated Testing: These unit tests can be run automatically using a test framework like JUnit. If any test fails, the developer is alerted, allowing them to fix the issue before deploying the code.
